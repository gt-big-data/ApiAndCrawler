# Twitter Project Documentation

Welcome to the Big Data Club's twitter project!

This project contains all of the code used to populate and maintain the Twitter database that we use. Our server is located at [143.215.138.132:5000](143.215.138.132:5000), but all of the code lives here!

For documentation and code etiquette for committing, go to our [wiki](https://github.com/gt-big-data/ApiAndCrawler/wiki)
